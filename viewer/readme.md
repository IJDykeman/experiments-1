Viewer -- CPlotPlot
===================

Visualization in C++ is very frustrating. There are few idiomatic C++11 libraries that just let you throw down objects into a gl window without much thought.

Viewer (CPlotPlot) aims to achieve this. It's a super quick way to throw arbitrary `primitives` into a view.
