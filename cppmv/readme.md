# Why

* Reducing the friction to doing simple things is of tremendous and often underestimated value
* The minor yak-shaves require at most minutes, meaning that the 8 hour exercise of implementing this tool is wasted, right?
    * Every yak-shave constitutes a loss of focus. Focus takes at least 30min to regain, effectively making any minor diversion at least a 30min diversion


# TODO
- More useful errors
- Hints when you haven't properly specified headers
- A "known libs" mapping from headers to lib objects
- Automatically find simple header/cc pairs and generate defaults unless there are annotations
