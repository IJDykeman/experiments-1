# Planning & Planning Tricks

[ ] Make a thing walk
[ ] Make a vehicle walk *like it is heavy*
[ ] Plan for a rolling ball
[ ] Make a plane fly like it's heavy


# Simulation
* "Powered" joints can apply torques on one axis
* Links separate joints, while fixing the distance between them

# Desires
* Store links as constraints and compute the lagrange multiplier? Or directly compute force?
* Ground-meeting joints could be expressed as lagrange constraints
